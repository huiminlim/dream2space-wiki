# Payload Setup

This documentation describes the setup for the Raspberry Pi off the package for the Payload.

The Payload uses a Raspberry Pi 3B+ credit card sized computer.

## Step 1: Insert micro SD card

| üí° | **Ensure that the Raspberry Pi and entire Cubesat is not powered up when carrying out this step.**                                                                                                                                      |
| -  | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    |

Ensure that the micro SD card provided in the package is inserted into the Raspberry Pi.

The micro SD card slot can be found on the side of the Raspberry Pi as shown in the image below.

| ‚ö†Ô∏è  | **Always ensure that the Raspberry Pi is shutdown properly as the SD card is prone to data corruption if shutdown is not done properly.** |

The micro SD card comes pre-loaded with the necessary setup to be done to run the Payload.

| üí° | **If there are any data corruption and/or SD card does not boot up as expected, refer to the [Appendix](./appendix.md) for information on how to reset the SD card.**                                                                                                                                      |

## Step 2: Power up the Raspberry Pi

Power up the Cubesat and the Raspberry Pi according to the hardware guide.

## Step 3: Access the Raspberry Pi

As the Raspberry Pi is a mini computer, there are several ways to access the Raspberry Pi and view the screens like a regular PC.

Here are some of the ways, depending on which is the most suitable and convenient method for you.

Here are some suggestions.
