<img src="ground_stn_images/cygwin-save-location.png" alt="Cygwin Root Install Directory" width="55%"/>

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download the Ground Station app

To begin, download the Ground Station app.

Download the latest version of the Ground Station app `Ground_Station.exe` from the `Releases` page [here](https://github.com/dream2space/dream2space-ground_station/releases/tag/v1.0).

Link to download Ground Station app: <https://github.com/dream2space/dream2space-ground_station/releases/tag/v1.0>

The `Releases` page should look like this:

![Ground Station exe releases](images/ground_stn_exe_releases.png)

You can find the latest version of the Ground Station app and the Version tag in the table below.

| Executable Name      | Version Number |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| `Ground_Station.exe` | `v1.0`         |

The download link of the `Ground_Station.exe` app is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** box in the screenshot below.

![Download app](images/ground_stn_exe_releases-dow.png)

Click on the `Ground_Station.exe` under the `Assets` section to download it.

### Step 2: Setup the Ground Station transceivers

The Ground Station has two 433 MHz transceivers to communicate with the TT&C and the Payload of the Dream2space cubesat respectively.

This is how a transceiver looks like:

<img src="ground_stn_images/transceiver-front-back.png" alt="Transceiver" width="50%"/>

The transceiver uses the Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) protocol to send data to and from the transceiver.

As most computers are unable to communicate via UART directly, a USB-UART bridge to connect the transceiver to the computer's USB ports.

This is how a USB-UART bridge looks like:

<img src="ground_stn_images/usb-uart-bridge.png" alt="USB-UART bridge" width="50%"/>

An example of the transceiver connected to the USB-UART bridge that you have received is shown below:

<img src="ground_stn_images/transceiver-bridge-connected.jpg" alt="USB-UART bridge connected to transceiver" width="40%"/>

Double check that the pin connections are done as shown in the table below:

| USB-UART bridge | Transceiver |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `5V`            | `Vcc`       |
| `GND`           | `GND`       |
| `TX`            | `RX`        |
| `RX`            | `TX`        |

| üí° | This table is also a handy reference if connections are removed by mistake! |
| -- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Step 3: Connect the TTnC transceiver to the Computer

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | **The sequence of plugging in the USB-UART bridges is important. Do try to follow the sequence.** |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

The computer identifies the USB-UART bridges as virtual `COM` ports and each bridge is assigned a unique `COM` port number upon plugging in the USB.

The Ground Station app needs to know `COM` port number for the TT&C and Payload transceiver to read and write to the respective transceivers.

The TT&C transceiver comes with a label on the transceiver, as shown in the image below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/ttnc-transceiver-bridge.jpg" alt="USB-UART bridge connected to TT&C transceiver" width="80%"/>

Plug in the TT&C transceiver's USB-UART bridge into the computer. The computer should detect the USB `COM` port and the `COM` port can be found using the Device Manager.

Note down the `COM` port for the TT&C transceiver's USB-UART bridge.

### Step 4: Connect the Payload transceiver to the Computer

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | **The sequence of plugging in the USB-UART bridges is important. Do try to follow the sequence.** |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

The payload transceiver comes with a label on the transceiver, as shown in the image below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/payload-transceiver-bridge.jpg" alt="USB-UART bridge connected to payload transceiver" width="80%"/>

Plug in the Payload transceiver's USB-UART bridge into the computer. The computer should detect the USB `COM` port and the `COM` port can be found using the Device Manager.

Note down the `COM` port for the Payload transceiver's USB-UART bridge.

### Step 5: Open up the Ground Station app

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | **This is the recommended way to open up the GUI exe. Other methods may cause errors.** |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded GUI exe, as shown in the folder below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/downloads-folder.png" alt="Downloads folder with GUI exe"/>

Double click on the icon to launch the app. The icon is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the the screenshot below.

If the app has launched successfully, the Start Page, as shown in screenshot below, will appear.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-start-page.png" alt="App Start Page" width="50%"/>

A `dream2space` folder will also be created in the same folder to store data collected from the app.

The folder is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/downloads-folder-after-open.png" alt="App Start Page" />

| ‚ö†Ô∏è | **Do not delete that folder while the app is running!** |

A Mission command window will pop up, as shown in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-window.png" alt="Mission command window" width="90%"/>

### Step 2: Fill in Mission Start date and time

Fill in the Mission Start date and time in the `Mission Start Date` and `Mission Start Time` panels.

There are some rules that the Mission Start date and time needs to adhere to:

  1. The Mission Start date and time must be in the future.

  2. It is recommended to be at least 2 minutes from the current time.

  3. The Mission Start time must not be less than 15 seconds before or after an already scheduled Mission.

  4. There can only be at most 3 incomplete missions at any time.

The `Mission Start Date` and `Mission Start Time` panels are boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-window-mission-start.png" alt="Input Mission start date and time" width="90%"/>

### Step 3: Fill in Mission images and interval

Fill in the number of image to be taken in the mission in the `Mission Image Count` panel and the interval between each image in the `Mission Image Interval` panel.

The `Mission Image Count` and `Mission Image Interval` panels are boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-window-mission-params.png" alt="Input mission parameters" width="90%"/>

In each field, there are some allowed values that these mission parameters are allowed to take.

The table below shows the values allowed for the `Mission Image Count` and the `Mission Image Interval` field.

| Field                    | Units | Min    | Max    |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| `Mission Image Count`    | N/A   | `1`    | `3`    |
| `Mission Image Interval` | ms    | `1000` | `5000` |

Use the arrows to select the values to input for each mission parameter.

### Step 4: Fill in Downlink Start date and time

Fill in the Downlink Start date and time in the `Downlink Start Date` and `Downlink Start Time` panels.

There are some rules that the Downlink Start date and time needs to adhere to:

  1. The Downlink Start date and time must be in the future.

  2. The Downlink Start date and time must be after the Mission Start date and time.

  3. The Downlink Start date and time must not be less than 10 minutes before or after an already scheduled Downlink.

The `Mission Start Date` and `Mission Start Time` panels are boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

### Step 6: Waiting for Mission to be executed

After the Submit button is clicked, the Mission command will be sent to the Dream2space Cubeat.

While the command is being sent, the progress bar will be shown.

To ensure that the Housekeeping command is sent without disruption, all commands sending will be disabled.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-sending-cmd.png" alt="Mission command sending" width="90%"/>

After the mission command is sent, a mission record is kept in the `Missions Pending Downlink` panel.

The record will be stored here until 2 minutes before the Downlink time of the Mission.

An example of a mission record in the `Missions Pending Downlink` panel is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-sending-cmd-record.png" alt="Mission record" width="90%"/>

### Step 7: Waiting for Downlink to be completed

When a mission is 2 minutes away from its Downlink time, the Ground Station will enter standby mode to wait for the downlink of images.

When this happens, the mission record will be shifted from the `Missions Pending Downlink` panel to the `Missions Currently in Downlink` panel.

An example of a mission record in the `Missions Currently in Downlink` panel is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-downlink-standby.png" alt="Downlink standby" width="90%"/>

The mission record will remain there until the completion of downlink, error correction and decoding and of images collected (if successful).

### Step 8: Viewing status of Missions

After the completion of downlink, the mission record will be removed from the `Missions Currently in Downlink` panel.

To view the overall status of the mission, click on the button to view completed mission/downlink operations.

The button is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-completed.png" alt="Mission view completed button" width="90%"/>

Clicking on the button opens up a CSV file containing the status records of all missions executed.

The table below describes what it means for an operation to be successful or have failed:

| Status    | Meaning                                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUCCESS` | All the process (Downlink, Error correction with Reed-Solomon, Decoding/Processing of images) are completed successfully. |
| `FAILED`  | One of the above mentioned processes have failed.                                                                         |

The screenshot below shows an example if the status if the mission was successful.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-overall-status.png" alt="View overall status of missions" width="90%"/>

The screenshot below shows an example if the status if the mission has failed.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-overall-status-fail.png" alt="View overall status of missions with fail" width="90%"/>

### Step 9: Viewing Mission status and images

Clicking on the button also opens up an explorer to view the list of folders where mission images are stored in.

Click on the folder containing the executed mission to view the contents.

For example, the folder with the mission previously executed is boxed in **<span style="color: lime">green</span>** in the screenshot below.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-location.png" alt="Mission saved location" width="90%"/>

If the mission was successful, the recovered images will be found in the folder.

A text file log of the detailed mission status will also be found in the folder.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-mission-folder.png" alt="View mission folder" width="90%"/>

Opening the text log file will show the status of each process that the Ground Station undertakes to recieve, perform error correction and decode the image.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-mission-status.png" alt="View mission status" width="65%"/>

This is important in the scenario to find out what is wrong in the downlink process.

For example, the logs below show that the decoding of the images using Base64 has failed.

<img src="ground_stn_images/app-mission-view-mission-status-fail.png" alt="View mission status with fail" width="65%"/>

This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting the connections and transmission between the Cubesat and the Ground Station.
