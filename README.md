This repo contains the wiki files for the dream2space Cubesat.

## Users' Guide Documentation Plans

This section keeps a record of the documentation plans for the Software part of the dream2space Cubesat, meant for **users**.

These documentations are meant for users of **2** types of audience:

1. Staff involved to mass produce SD cards ready for use.

2. Students who are using the SD cards in the Cubesat kit.

There are **4** planned documentations to be completed.

1. Raspberry Pi Documentation for **Mass Pre-Production** of the SD cards **before they are dispatched**.

2. Raspberry Pi Documentation for users' **first normal intended** boot.

3. Raspberry Pi Documentation for users to re-setup SD cards **if operation failures occur**.

4. Ground Station Documentation for users.

## Developers' Guide Documentation Plans

***TLDR: Read to get a broad idea and get your hands dirty in the code!***

This section keeps a record of the documentation plans for the Software developed for the dream2space Cubesat, meant for **developers**.

For future development of the Ground Station, Payload Manager and Cubesat Subsystems, detailed developer guides are developed for easy understanding of the Cubesat kit's software architecture.

Detailed code and conceptual explanations will **not** be provided and some level of embedded programming in C and general purpose Python programming is required.

There are **5** planned documentations to be completed (in order of priority):

1. Ground Station Software Architecture.

2. Payload Manager Software Architecture and Reliable Transmission design.

3. CSP Communication Protocol between Subsystems.

4. CCSDS Telemetry and Telecommand Packet Structure.

5. General Comments on each Subsystem.
