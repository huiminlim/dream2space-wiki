# Appendix - Setup Raspberry Pi SD card

This documentation describes the setup for the Raspberry Pi SD card for the Payload.

## Step 1: Install Raspbian OS

Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the website [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).

Install the Raspberry Pi Imager and launch the Application once installed. The application looks like this.

![Raspberry Pi imager](images/rpiimager.png)

Click `Choose OS` and select the recommended first option, `Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)`.

Insert the MicroSD card into the PC and click `Choose Storage` to flash the OS onto under the `Storage` tab.

Select the storage volume to flash the OS onto.

Wait for the flashing to complete.

## Step 2: Set up the SD Card to enable SSH

Remove and insert the SD card into the PC again.

Enter the `boot` drive that the PC detects.

Create an empty file name `ssh` in `boot`.

This is done by going through the right click menu and creating a file as such.

## Step 4: Boot up the Raspberry Pi

Boot up the Raspberry Pi and wait for a few minutes until the Yellow LED remains stable for around 5 minutes.

## Step 5: Access the Raspberry Pi

Using any of the methods described in the main document, access the Raspberry Pi.

## Step 5: Enable VNC UART interfaces

Type `sudo raspi-config` into the terminal to enter the configuration screen to start VNC.

Navigate to the Interface options and press enter.

When prompted to reboot, selected yes and wait for 5 minutes until the Yellow LED stabilizes after 5 minutes.

### Step 6: Enable Camera interface

Use `sudo raspi-config` to enter the configuration screen to enable the camera interface.

Similar to the previous step, navigate to the Interface options and press enter.

Select Camera option and press enter.

![Camera interface](images/camerainterface.png)

Select yes and press enter.

Similarly, leave the configuration page by selecting finish.

When prompted to reboot, selected yes and wait for 5 minutes until the Yellow LED stabilizes after 5 minutes.

### Step 7: Use VNC

Use VNC to view the GUI desktop of the Raspberry Pi.

Enter `raspberrypi.local` into the top bar to connect to the Raspberry Pi via VNC.

Once entered into the GUI, enter the default username and password.

### Step 8: Set up UART

Source: [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md) and [here](https://www.circuits.dk/setup-raspberry-pi-3-gpio-uart/)

Open up the terminal and issue the following command.

```bash
dmesg | grep tty
```

The following screen should be observed, with the `PL011` connected to the `ttyAMA01`.

![ttyAMA01](images/AMA01.png)

Issue the `sudo raspi-config` command and navigate to the `Interface Options` and then to `Serial Port`, the press enter.

![Serial Port](images/Serialport.png)

When prompted about the login shell over console, select No.

![Login Shell over Console](images/loginshellconsole.png)

When prompted about enabling hardware serial, select Yes.

![Hardware Serial](images/hardwareserial.png)

Exit the configuration page and reboot.

Once the reboot is successful, issue the following command into the terminal.

```bash
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Add these 2 lines to the end of the file if they are not already there.

```bash
enable_uart=1
core_freq=250
```

![Config file](images/bootconfig.png)

Press `Ctrl+X`, `Y` and enter to save and exit the file.

Proceed to reboot the Raspberry Pi for changes to take effect.
